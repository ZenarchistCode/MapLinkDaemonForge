What Is This?

This mod allows server admins to link multiple maps together in a "hive", where players can move between maps with their characters and loot like you can on certain official servers.

The player is required to travel to a "transfer terminal" to initiate the map transfer (ie. a boat, helicopter, computer object etc placed with DayZ Editor).

I did not create this mod: I've simply updated and repacked it for use with DayZ 1.28, fixed a bunch of error log messages and recorded a detailed video guide on how to set the whole thing up.

All credit goes to Daemonforge who is the original creator of this mod.

Installation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod (there are many guides out there) - copy it into your server folder and add it to your server mods list. It must be run on both server and client. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys.

There is a YouTube video on my channel explaining how the mod works: https://youtu.be/1slJ5msQiVA

There are example config files and more info in the "extras" folder inside the mod.

All my mods are free and open source, but it takes an enormous amount of time to put some of these mods together. If I've helped you out, please consider helping me buy my next coffee! I don't expect it, but I very much appreciate it.
